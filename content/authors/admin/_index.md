I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at KAUST, working on reasoning and Arabic large language models (LLMs). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at INRIA within the CEDAR team, France, where I focused on bias detection in large language models. Starting next semester, I will be joining the Lebanese American University as a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics. I completed my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris, under the supervision of Prof. Fabian Suchanek and Prof. Chlo√© Clavel, where I focused on evaluating and improving the reasoning abilities of language models. I hold an MSc in Computer Science from the American University of Beirut and a BSc from Notre Dame University - Louaize. My research spans areas such as Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning for healthcare, and enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models.
