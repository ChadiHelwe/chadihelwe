I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at INRIA within the CEDAR team, France, working on bias detection and mitigation in large language models. I completed my Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence at the Institut Polytechnique de Paris, under the supervision of Prof. Fabian Suchanek and Prof. Chlo√© Clavel, where I focused on evaluating and improving the reasoning abilities of language models. I hold an MSc in Computer Science from the American University of Beirut and a BSc from Notre Dame University - Louaize. My research spans areas such as Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning for healthcare, and enhancing the reasoning capabilities of language models.
